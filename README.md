The aim was to analyze and gain insights into the overall crime trends in Calgary from 2019 to 2022 across different sectors, including North, South, West East, 
Center, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast. The study aimed to identify the communities with the highest and lowest crime rates, understand the impact
of population on crime rates, and determine the most prevalent types of crime in the city.

In order to accurately analyze the data and gain insights, it was necessary to understand the data including identifying missing values,
abnormality, outliers,and completeness. This was achieved using SQL and Excel, which provided descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, average, maximum, and minimum. Data exploration

completeness. This was achieved using Excel, which provided descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, average, maximum, and minimum. Data exploration was
completed using conditional formatting.

The data was loaded into Tableau using extract connection, and various worksheets were created to analyze the data. Parameters and sets were created to analyze the top
and bottom communities with the highest crime rates, and table calculations were performed to find the percentage difference of crime in different sectors.

The study resulted in the creation of a fully interactive dashboard that provides insights into different categories of crime such as theft from vehicles, assaults,
and more, happening in different sectors of the city from 2019 to 2022.

Important insights from the study revealed that January had the highest crime rate while December had the lowest crime rate over the period. The center of Calgary
had the highest crime rate, followed by Northeast, while Southwest had a significantly lower rate of crime. The study also found an inverse relationship between crime
rate and population. The Beltline community had the highest crime rate, while communities such as 02L, 05E, 05F, 12I, and 12K had the lowest rates.
